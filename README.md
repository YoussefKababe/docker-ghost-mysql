Ghost Dockerfile with MySQL support
===================================

This image is based of [dockerfile/ghost](https://github.com/dockerfile/ghost), but adds support for MySQL!

You can now configure your dockerized ghost blog to use a MySQL database instead of SQLite.

For more information on usage and customization, please read [the base image's documentation](https://github.com/dockerfile/ghost/blob/master/README.md)
